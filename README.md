📘 Library Management System (Java Console Project)

🧩 Overview

The Library Management System is a console-based Java application designed to manage a small-scale library.
It allows users to add books, display available books, search, borrow, and return books — all through a simple menu-driven interface.

💡 This project demonstrates core Java concepts such as:

📊 Arrays — Storing books, authors, and borrowed records

🔀 Conditional Statements — Decision-making for book availability

🔁 Loops — Iterating through records

🧩 Methods — Modular code design

🧮 User Input Handling (Scanner) — Interactive console inputs

🧠 Data Organization & Logic Implementation — Core programming foundation

⚙️ Features

| Feature                  | Description                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 📚 **Add Book**          | Add Fiction or Non-Fiction books with details |
| 🔍 **Search Book**       | Find books by title (case-insensitive)        |
| 📖 **Display All Books** | View all available books in the library       |
| 🧾 **Borrow Book**       | Borrow a book if copies are available         |
| 🔁 **Return Book**       | Return borrowed books and update copies       |
| 🚪 **Exit**              | Gracefully exit the application               |

🖥️ Displays a menu with options (Add, Display, Search, Borrow, Return, Exit).

🧭 User selects an option (1–6).

⚙️ The respective method executes the logic.

📦 Data is stored in arrays (in memory).

🔄 Borrowing & returning updates the copies dynamically.

🛑 Program runs until the user chooses Exit.

💡 Example Flow
--- Library Management System ---
1. Add Book
2. Display All Books
3. Search Book by Title
4. Borrow Book
5. Return Book
6. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter book type (1 for Fiction, 2 for Non-Fiction): 1
Enter book title: Harry Potter
Enter author: J.K. Rowling
Enter number of copies: 5
Book added successfully!

Enter your choice: 2
Title: Harry Potter, Author: J.K. Rowling, Copies: 5
Subject: Fiction
